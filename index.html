      <p>Welcome to my portfolio page! My name is Roy Reyna and I currently reside in San Antonio, TX. I'm a military kid so I've been all over the country. I moved to Texas after my dad retired in 2005 and I have moved out since. I started off in the Rio Grande Valley, home to some of the best citrus out there, and now I'm enjoying it here in San Antonio!</p>

      <p>Some of my hobbies include watching football (#TitanUp!), listening to metalcore and EDM music, and traveling. I am busy body and find it really hard to stay put. I have a beautiful wife of 7 years, no kids, no pets and we're loving our time together. We just purchased a new home and now I'm excited to begin learning Full Stack Web Development in hopes of a career change.</p>
     
      <p>I've been a high school math teacher for the past 8 years teaching subjects like Algebra 2 and AP Calculus. While I do love the math content and the eagerness some of my students exhibit on a daily basis, I feel like it's time to leave the education field. My degree is in Applied Mathematics and I took several coding classes in college because I was on the fence about obtaining a CS degree. As time as gone on, I've wondered more and more about what it would've been like if I continued to code. So now I'm here to find out! I'm excited about what's in store for my future.</p>
